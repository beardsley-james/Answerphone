* Acquisition of operators
* Client acquisition
* Jiggle number values to make it actually fun
* Maybe some kind of animation so it doesn't look so jumpy
* Why do the stupid op boxes flop around all over the place? Maybe fix that too
* Get some more names
* Clear call queue at day end, or leave it alone so it starts over at midnight
* Set it up so it goes through days of the week
* Holidays/bad weather days
* Set end of day report to reset between days (important)
* Make operators work for certain amounts of time and pay them
* Speed up time when there aren't calls coming in
* Implement backgrounds/experience and focus/personability, make sure they effect some of the game options
* Set up an upgrade tree and gate certain kinds of information/options behind that tree, but also have a debug option to activate everything and give you a bunch of money
* Save!
* Client satisfaction levels based on lost calls and quality of service
* Switch out the callGrabber function to work with indexes instead of just "pop"
* Organize functions and variables a bit better.
* Display op cards when the possibleOps array is populated
* Generate advertisement list dynamically based on what's in the database
* Add an "unlocked" feature to the advertisement database for opening up upgrade paths
