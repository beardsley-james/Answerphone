# How to play

You've decided to strike out on your own and start your own answering service! You begin with a single client and as you answer calls and make money you can start advertising campaigns to get employees to answer for you and additional clients whose calls you'll have to answer. Eventually you'll become the powerful owner of a globe-spanning empire of call centers!

## Speed Controls

You can control the speed at which the game runs by using the buttons at the beginning of the command bar. At first you'll have only two speeds, "Auto" and ">". Auto will fast forward time until calls appear in the call queue ready to be answered manually, while ">" advances time at a more sedate rate giving you time to purchase upgrades and handle management decisions. Additional speeds can be unlocked in the Upgrades menu.

## Call Monitoring

The four boxes in the second section of the command show what's going on with the call queues and basic statistics for the day. Blue is how many live calls are ringing, red is how many holding calls are ringing, black is completed calls and orange is the number of calls that have been lost. Lost calls make your clients unhappy, so keep that number down!

## Call activity

The call activity section is where you can see which operators are currently on the board, what they're doing, and what's going on with your call activity. You can click on calls in the live calls section (blue) to put them into the holding queue, where they can last longer without hanging up, and you can click on calls in the holding queue to answer them manually, increasing the satisfaction of your clients and the money in your bank account.

## Human resources

This section of the menu lets you look over your hired staff and see how much you're paying them, what their hours are, and how happy they are with their current employment. It also lets you review the applications of people that want to work for you and choose to hire them or not depending on your staffing needs.

## Client management

This section displays both active clients and clients you can choose to accept contracts with. Active clients can be terminated or, with an upgrade purchase, you can choose to increase the rates they pay you per call but be careful! Raising rates with decrease client satisfaction and possibly cause them to cease operations with your company.

## Reports

This is where you're going to be able to look over financial reports, projections, call activity logs, and review your staffing schedule but there's nothing here yet so

## Advertising

The advertising menu lets you start advertising campaigns to get new clients or operators to join your growing business. Advertising campaigns cost money, though, so save up and plan ahead. The game starts with only two unlocked advertising campaigns but more can be made available in the next menu.

## Upgrades

This menu lets you purchase upgrades to improve the availability of advertising campaigns as well as unlock new interface features. Campaigns can be tailored to get you certain kinds of operators and you can even choose to specialize in particular kinds of clients but be careful since that doesn't do anything yet and it's a waste of money.

## Big Money

The number at the end of the command bar shows how much money you have and it's the most important thing in the game. Bigger numbers are better!
